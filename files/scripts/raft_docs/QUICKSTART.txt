# WELCOME TO RAFT!
#
# This guide is meant to be a starting point for creating RAFT scripts.
# For additional information, please see the README and provided "raft_docs" scripts.
#
# Let's begin with the basics:
#
# Comments begin with #, so any line starting with # is ignored 
#
# A paragraph (separated by empty lines) within a text file is a "block". 
# This is the typical format for a block:

@raft_docs_block_name
# Some comments below the block name, if desired
# ...
PRINT hello world

# The command above uses the "PRINT" command to simply print 
# all the text that follows (in this case, "hello world")
# The name of the block must be the first line of the block and
# must start with an @
#
# If a block does not start with a name, it is considered unnamed
# and simply executed when encountered. Under normal circumstances,
# that's not the intended behavior, so all blocks should be given a name.
#
# Named blocks are called (triggered) as follows:

@raft_docs_print_hello_world
raft_docs_block_name

# In the example above, the "raft_docs_print_hello_world" block triggers
# the "hello world" print by simply entering its name in the block body.
#
# Blocks can also take variables in $variableName format:

@raft_docs_custom_printer
$toPrint
PRINT $toPrint

# These blocks can be called with:

@raft_docs_custom_printer_caller
raft_docs_custom_printer $toPrint="hello world"

# Or even take arguments of their own and pass them through to other 
# functions:

@raft_docs_custom_printer_other_caller
$toPrint
raft_docs_custom_printer $toPrint=$toPrint

# For a detailed guide, please see the functions_and_variables documentation.
# 
# Now, let's use this basic structure to create some actual scripts!
#
# TODO -- endpoints, basic commands, how to run
